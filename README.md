<p A simple word editor for multiple Microsoft Word files </p>


##What is this software?

One friend of mine asked me if I can make a simple software that can edit multiple Microsoft Word documents at the same time, including fucntions like substituting keywords, searching keywords in multiple Word Document. When I search online on Github, I didn't find any software that can do those, and python-docx didn't support direct replace or search with multiple files, so I simply make one, hope you enjoy this little software!

一个简单的能在多个Microsoft Word文档里，代替关键词、查找关键词的小软件。
